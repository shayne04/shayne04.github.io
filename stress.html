      <h1>What is stress?</h1>
      <p>
        Stress is a natural, human response to situations that feel difficult to manage or out of our control. It might be a feeling of pressure in response to a heavy workload, or overwhelm after an argument with a loved one. It could also be the thoughts that keep you awake at night when worrying about money.
        <br>
        Yes, stress affects us all – sometimes in very different ways. However, stress can become overwhelming if we deem the situation to be unmanageable, creating various emotional and physical challenges that can vary in strength from person to person. </p>
     <h1>How can stress affect your everyday life?</h1>
      <p>Stress is like carrying a heavy backpack; at first, we don’t notice its burden and keep pushing forward. But, over time, as more items are added to the bag – such as responsibilities and worries – the load becomes heavier and increasingly difficult to manage.
        <br>
        So, if we don’t figure out how to deal with stress, it can affect our everyday life through how it affects our physical and mental health, relationships, and ability to complete everyday tasks.</p>
